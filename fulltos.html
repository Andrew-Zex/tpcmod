        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern the use of the TPC Bot (“Bot”) available on the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please cease using the Bot.
        
        Any Discord server may use the TPC Bot for free, provided these Terms are followed. The use of the Bot is free for users; however, the server administrators are responsible for ensuring its proper use according to these Terms.
        
        You agree to use the TPC Bot solely for its intended purposes, such as moderation, event organization, user interaction, and other approved functions. Using the Bot for any other purposes, including manipulation, fraud, spam, or other abuse, is prohibited.
        
        It is prohibited to use the Bot for spamming, manipulating commands, distributing illegal, harmful, or offensive content. Additionally, creating artificial load on the system or exploiting the Bot’s functions is prohibited.
        
        The Bot may collect anonymous usage data to improve its performance and effectiveness. This data may include usage statistics, metadata, but will not be used to identify users without their knowledge. All collected data will be used solely for analysis and improving the Bot’s functionality.
        
        TPC Bot is provided “as is.” The developers of the Bot are not responsible for any damages, data loss, security issues, technical failures, or other complications that may arise from using the Bot. You use the Bot at your own risk.
        
        The developers reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Any changes will take effect after being posted on the official page. Continuing to use the Bot after changes means you agree to the updated Terms.
        
        Violating these Terms may result in termination of access to the Bot without prior warning. Users who abuse the Bot’s functionality or violate these Terms may be banned or restricted from accessing the Bot and its features.
